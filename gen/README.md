Submodules containing code generated by `genbindings` together with the `libseaqt` runtime.

Each submodule represents a git repository that contains a branch with the
generated code for the given Qt version - for example, code generated for
Qt 6.4 is added to the `qt-6.4` branch, as specified in the `.gitmodules` file.

The branches are created as [orphans branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout/2.47.1#Documentation/git-checkout.txt---orphanltnew-branchgt), with their starting point taken from
the contents of the latest `master` commit.

When rebasing `seaqt`, the branches are reset to this starting point from the
top-level `Makefile`:

```sh
make reset-gen
```

Each time a commit is added to `seaqt`, a corresponding commit with generated
code is added to these submodules, to examine the changes:

```sh
make gencommits
```

When creating a feature branch in the main repository, a branch should be
created for each of the submodules as well:

```sh
git switch -C myfeature
# create/switch to myfeature-X.X branches in each gen/ submodule
make genbranches
```

Users of `seaqt` can simply check out the appropriately versioned branch without
history, but are recommended to fork the repository at the time of their usage
since it will be recreated periodically.

The strategy will likely be revised in time for a stable `seaqt` release.
